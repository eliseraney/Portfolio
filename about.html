    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>SheCodes Student, based in Colorado, USA</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Elise Raney, and I currently own a successful dog walking and
      pet sitting business in Colorado Springs. While I absolutely love what I
      do, it certainly takes a toll on the body. For that reason, I am currently
      learning front-end development through SheCodes and am slated to complete
      their Pro certification early next year.
